The Starfleet Academy Program
Write a program to determine if a student will be accepted or rejected into Starfleet Academy. The decision will be based on GPA, SAT score, Age, and Planet of origin. The basic admission requirements are:
• GPA must be at least 2.0
• SAT must be at least 800
• Minimum Age is 16 for Vulcans, 17 for anyone else
• Race must not be Romulan
There are several exemptions to the above requirements
• If GPA is at least 3.5, applicant is exempted from the SAT requirement.
• If SAT is at least 1100, applicant is exempted from the GPA requirement.
• If SAT is at least 1500, applicant is exempted from the Age requirement
I will be running your programs multiple times, so to facilitate my testing please make your program accept input in the following sequence:
First name
Age
GPA
SAT
Race (Human, Vulcan, Klingon, Romulan)
A sample run might look like (bold indicates user input):
